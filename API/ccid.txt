c1s1 API file (CCID)

CCID - Client Communication Identification
CCID's purpose is to allow people on the same WIFI to use Multiplayer/Multiuser on the same server.


Identification :
Clients can be identified by the CCID only on one session, rendering it useless for identifying users for stored data.
CCID(s) will remain the same when being redirected to different server, allowing temporary user data to follow. (Read more on redirecting at /API/redirecting);

Security :
CCIDs could be manipulated and tampered with, although this should have no affect on anything.
Server should check that 2 CCIDs cannot be on same server to prevent user spoofing and accidental chance 2 clients pick same CCID.
